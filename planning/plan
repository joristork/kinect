Project plan: Kinect poster catcher
Date: 7 November 2011

Project team:
    Joris Stork, Lucas Swartsenburg, Sander van Veen, Bas Weelinck, Jimi van der
    Woning, Jeroen Zuiddam


Project description:

Our goal is threefold:

1. What is a Kinect? 
    To produce an overview of the mechanisms by which the Kinect senses colour
    and depth data, and how it provides this to a host computer. The team
    intends to glean this information from the web and from the software drivers
    that we will employ to interface with the Kinect. 

2. Precision of the Kinect as a scientific instrument.
    To collect data describing the Kinect's precision as a measurement tool.
    This may involve experimentation, although the team expects that all
    relevant information will be available on the Web.

3. Build a Kinect based application.
    To build a command-line interfaced application in Python, on top of
    ready-made (hacked) python wrappers for the Kinect. The application will
    require the placement of a Kinect in a room so that it has a clear view of
    some walls adorned with posters. The application will then process one
    depth-rgb reading pair, so that the posters are identified and individually
    transformed to the 2-D image plane, before being saved as separate image
    files on the host computer.


Time planning:
    
    Calendar week 45: Describe Kinect, choose and explore drivers.
        Sub-group 1: Choose a driver --> experiment with interface
                                     --> glean info about specs
        Sub-group 2: web reseach --> find info about specs
                                 --> find out "how it works"
        The groups should input findings into the report as they go along.
        Specifications and "how it works" sections of report should be
        completed by the end of this week.

    Calendar week 46: Sketch out application, assign modules to sub-teams.
        Build functional model of application.
        Assign application modules to sub-teams.
        Tentative goals: Identify wall-planes; identify poster-like objects.
        
    Calendar week 47: Develop modules
        Tentative goals: Identify posters.

    Calendar week 48: Develop modules
        Emphasis on integration and user interface.
        Tentative goals: Transform, apply any post-processing, and save posters

    Calendar week 49: Make it presentable
        Sub-group 1: Finalise report
        Sub-group 2: Finalise and present slideshow presentation
        Sub-group 3: Tie up loose ends in code. 
                     Demo application.

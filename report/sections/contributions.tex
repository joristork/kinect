\begin{itemize}
\item Made up the algorithm we are using.
\item Created "create\_module.py" to implement the algorithm.
\item Created "calibrate.py" to make a calibrating framework and to do a 
straighforward single camera calibration. This was needed to better understand 
all matrices needed and to continue work on "create\_module.py".
\item Created undistort\_static.py to see the effect of the we found on some images.
\item Saved npy images so that we can work using static images (without the Kinect).
\item Created Kinect.py to combine everything.
\item Created npy\_to\_png.png to transform npy arrays to images we can open 
using a image viewer.
\item Wrote the subsections Creating a model and Combining it all in the 
application section of the report.
\item Author of the interim report.
\end{itemize}

This report presents the results of a project to investigate and utilise the
depth measurement function of Microsoft's Kinect device. For our team of six
students at the Univeristy of Amsterdam, this project concludes the
undergraduate Computer Vision course (Beeldbewerken). Like our project, this
report is in two main parts.  The first describes the key results of our
investigation into the computer vision techniques and innovations that underlie
the Kinect's depth-measurement functionality. The second part describes our
effort to build an application that utilises the Kinect to construct
three-dimensional models of relatively small objects.

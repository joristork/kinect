This chapter presents the results of our research into the technical
underpinnings of the Kinect as a sensing device. Section \ref{howitworks}
describes techniques implemented in the Kinect to produces depth maps, in terms
of standard concepts from the field of machine vision. Then, section
\ref{precision} presents measurements, estimates and published data, which
together characterise the precision of the Kinect as a measurement tool.

\section{Overview: What is a Kinect}

The Kinect device is a sensor array incorporating, most notably, a system for
depth measurement. This system relies on a technique that enables low-cost
implementations. Several founders of an Israeli technology firm, PrimeSense Ltd,
invented the technique sometime before 11 October 2005 \cite{ZALEVSKY:2007}.
Microsoft corp., in turn, began selling the Kinect-branded implementation on 10
November 2010 as an optional user interface for its consumer gaming platform,
the Xbox 360.

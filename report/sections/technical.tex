In this chapter we attempt to describe: the theory behind the Kinect's depth
mapping functionality; and the precision of the Kinect as a measurement tool.

\section{Theory: How it works}

tell it how it is with foot/endnotes:

\subsection{Stereo triangulation}

the depth mapping employs triangulation

triangulation is...

\subsection{Stereo triangulation with projected dot pattern}

in the kinect a corresponds to a' etc
